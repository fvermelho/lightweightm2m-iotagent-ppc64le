# <a name="overview"/> Overview
The Lightweight M2M IoT Agent is a standard Fiware IoT Agent that implements the bridge of the OMA Lightweight M2M protocol
with the internal protocol for the FIWARE components (OMA NGSI). This IoT Agent is based in the public 
Node.js IoT Agent Library, where more information can be found about what the IoT Agents are and their different APIs. 

This project has, then, two APIs:
* The South Bound (LWM2M): information about it can be found in the [OMA Lightweight M2M](http://openmobilealliance.hs-sites.com/lightweight-m2m-specification-from-oma) official page. Information about the subset of Lightweight M2M already supported can be found in the [LWM2M Library for Node.js](https://github.com/telefonicaid/lwm2m-node-lib) we are using.
* The North Bound Administration API: all the IoT Agents share a single Administration API, and it can be found in the [Node.JS IoT Agent Library Documentation](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotagent-node-lib).
* The North Bound NGSI API: information about the northbound NGSI mapping can be obtained in the same Node.JS IOTA Library documentation.
 
You will find examples and more detailed information in the Getting Started howtos below.
 
# <a name="gettingstarted"/> Getting started
This document links a set of howtos oriented to give a quick step-by-step example on how to use the agent with 
different types of configurations. It's important to remark that those configuration options are not mutually exclusive:
an IoT Agent can have some device preprovisioned, some configuration groups defined and some static configurations also,
each for different types of devices.

Some of the guides will share the use of a faked device type called `Robot` with the following characteristics:
* be part of the service `Factory` and subservice `/robots`.
* have an active attribute called `Battery` with type `number`, mapped to the LWM2M resource ID /7392/0/1.
* have a passive attribute called `Message` with type `string`, mapped to the LWM2M resource ID /7392/0/2.
* have a command attribute called `Position` with type `location`, mapped to the LWM2M resource ID /7392/0/3.

Some guides will show the use of the automatic OMA Registry mapping, using a faked device of type 'WeatherBaloon', 
with the following characteristics:
* be part of the service `Weather` and subservice `/baloons`.
* a passive attribute with resource ID /6/0/0 (Position: Longitude).
* a passive attribute with resource ID /6/0/1 (Position: Latitude).
* a passive attribute with resource ID /3303/0/0 (Temperature Sensor).
* an active attribute with resource ID /3312/0/0 (Power Control).

Each guide is presented with a brief explanation about its contents:

* [Device Provisioning Guide](deviceProvisioning.md): this guide shows how to configure, launch and use an IoT Agent,
provisioning each device before sending its measures.
* [Configuration Provisioning Guide](configurationProvisioning.md): this guide shows how to configure a group of devices
for being autoprovisioned when they register in the agent.
* [Static Configuration Guide](staticConfiguration.md): this guide shows how to configure static routes that map incoming
devices to different statically configured types.
 
# <a name="testing"/> Testing
The IoT Agent comes with a test suite to check the main functionalities. In order to execute the test suite you must have the Grunt client installed. You can install it using the following command (you will need root permissions):
```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```
Once the client is installed and the dependencies are downloaded, you can execute the tests using:
```
grunt
```
This will execute the functional tests and the syntax checking as well.

NOTE: This are end to end tests, so they execute against real instances of the components (so make sure you have a real Context Broker configured in the config.js). Be aware that the tests clean the databases before and after they have been executed so DO NOT EXECUTE THIS TESTS ON PRODUCTION MACHINES.

# <a name="development"/> Development
## Project build
The project is managed using Grunt Task Runner.

For a list of available task, type
```bash
grunt --help
```

The following sections show the available options in detail.

## Contribution Guidelines

### Overview
Being an Open Source project, everyone can contribute, provided that it respect the following points:
* Before contributing any code, the author must make sure all the tests work (see below how to launch the tests). 
* Developed code must adhere to the syntax guidelines enforced by the linters.
* Code must be developed following the branching model and changelog policies defined below.
* For any new feature added, unit tests must be provided, following the example of the ones already created.

In order to start contributing:
1. Fork this repository clicking on the "Fork" button on the upper-right area of the page.
2. Clone your just forked repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/lightweightm2m-iotagent.git
```
3. Add the main lightweightm2m-iotagent repository as a remote to your forked repository (use any name for your remote 
repository, it does not have to be lightweightm2m-iotagent, although we will use it in the next steps):
```
git remote add lightweightm2m-iotagent https://github.com/telefonicaid/lightweightm2m-iotagent.git
```

Before starting contributing, remember to synchronize the `develop` branch in your forked repository with the `develop` 
branch in the main lightweightm2m-iotagent repository, by following this steps

1. Change to your local `develop` branch (in case you are not in it already):
```
  git checkout develop
```
2. Fetch the remote changes:
```
  git fetch lightweightm2m-iotagent
```
3. Merge them:
```
  git rebase lightweightm2m-iotagent/develop
```

Contributions following this guidelines will be added to the `develop` branch, and released in the next version. The 
release process is explaind in the *Releasing* section below.


### Branching model
There are two special branches in the repository:

* `master`: holds the code for the last stable version of the project. It is only updated when a new version is released,
and its always updated with the current state of `develop`.
* `develop`: contains the last stable development code. New features and bug fixes are always merged to `develop`.

In order to start developing a new feature or refactoring, a new branch should be created with name `task/<taskName>`.
This branch must be created from the current version of the `develop` branch. Once the new functionality has been
completed, a Pull Request will be created from the feature branch to `develop`. Remember to check both the linters
and the tests before creating the Pull Request.

Bug fixes work the same way as other tasks, with the exception of the branch name, that should be called `bug/<bugName>`.

In order to contribute to the repository, these same scheme should be replicated in the forked repositories, so the 
new features or fixes should all come from the current version of `develop` and end up in `develop` again.

All the `task/*` and `bug/*` branches are temporary, and should be removed once they have been merged.

There is another set of branches called `release/<versionNumber>`, one for each version of the product. This branches
point to each of the released versions of the project, they are permanent and they are created with each release.

### Changelog
The project contains a version changelog, called CHANGES_NEXT_RELEASE, that can be found in the root of the project.
Whenever a new feature or bug fix is going to be merged with `develop`, a new entry should be added to this changelog.
The new entry should contain the reference number of the issue it is solving (if any). 

When a new version is released, the changelog is cleared, and remains fixed in the last commit of that version. The
content of the changelog is also moved to the release description in the Github release.

### Releasing
The process of making a release consists of the following steps:
1. Create a new task branch changing the development version number in the package.json (with a sufix `-next`), to the
new target version (without any sufix), and PR into `develop`.
2. Create a tag from the last version of `develop` named with the version number and push it to the repository.
3. Create the release in Github, from the created tag. In the description, add the contents of the Changelog.
4. Create a release branch from the last version of `develop` named with the version number.
5. PR `develop` into `master`.
6. Create a new task for preparing the next release, adding the sufix `-next` to the current version number (to signal
this as the development version).

## Testing
### Prerequisites
Its important to remark that this component's tests are End To End tests, that have some software requirements to be run.
This requirements are the following:
* An instance of MongoDB running in `localhost`.
* An instance of Orion Context Broker running in the location configured in `testConfig.js` (defaults to the alias `oriondb`). 
This instance has to have the 1026 and 27017 open for connections coming from the Grunt tester.

### Libraries
[Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) Test Runner + [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) Assertion Library + [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/) Spies, stubs.

The test environment is preconfigured to run [BDD](http://chaijs.com/api/bdd/) testing style with
`chai.expect` and `chai.should()` available globally while executing tests, as well as the [Sinon-Chai](http://chaijs.com/plugins/sinon-chai) plugin.

Module mocking during testing can be done with [proxyquire](https://github.com/thlorenz/proxyquire)

### Execution
To run tests, type
```bash
grunt test
```

Tests reports can be used together with Jenkins to monitor project quality metrics by means of TAP or XUnit plugins.
To generate TAP report in `report/test/unit_tests.tap`, type
```bash
grunt test-report
```


## Coding guidelines
Uses provided .jshintrc and .gjslintrc flag files. The latter requires Python and its use can be disabled
while creating the project skeleton with grunt-init.
To check source code style, type
```bash
grunt lint
```

Checkstyle reports can be used together with Jenkins to monitor project quality metrics by means of Checkstyle
and Violations plugins.
To generate Checkstyle and JSLint reports under `report/lint/`, type
```bash
grunt lint-report
```


## Continuous testing
Support for continuous testing by modifying a src file or a test.
For continuous testing, type
```bash
grunt watch
```


## Source Code documentation
Generates HTML documentation under `site/doc/`. It can be used together with jenkins by means of DocLinks plugin.
For compiling source code documentation, type
```bash
grunt doc
```


## Code Coverage
Analizes the code coverage of your tests.

To generate an HTML coverage report under `site/coverage/` and to print out a summary, type
